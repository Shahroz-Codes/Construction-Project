# 🏗️ Project Milestones & Flow (MERN — 6–7 weeks plan)

---

## **Milestone 1: Backend Foundation (Week 1)** ✅ (You just finished!)

* Setup **Express + MongoDB** connection.
* Add `.env` and secure configs.
* Confirm server runs + DB connects.

---

## **Milestone 2: User Authentication (Week 2)**

* **User model** (`name, email, password, role`).
* Roles: `admin`, `wholesaler`, `retailer`, `customer`.
* **Register API** (hash password with `bcryptjs`).
* **Login API** (issue JWT).
* **Auth middleware** → protects routes.
* Test with Postman.

👉 Deliverable: “Multi-role login system”

---

## **Milestone 3: Product & Inventory (Week 3)**

* **Product model** (`name, category, price, stock, supplier`).
* CRUD routes:

  * Admin/Wholesaler → add/update/delete product.
  * Customer → only view products.
* Stock automatically decreases when order is placed.
* “Low stock alert” (log/notification).

👉 Deliverable: “Working inventory with role-based product management.”

---

## **Milestone 4: Orders & Checkout (Week 4)**

* **Order model** (`user, items[], totalPrice, status`).
* Customer places order.
* Admin/Wholesaler updates order status (pending, shipped, delivered).
* Generate **invoice (PDF)**.
* Add payment mock (Cash on Delivery + Stripe sandbox).

👉 Deliverable: “Full order workflow with invoice.”

---

## **Milestone 5: Supplier & Bulk Features (Week 5)**

* Allow multiple suppliers for same material.
* Supplier rating/reviews system.
* Bulk order discount logic (if qty > X → apply discount).
* Optional: simple bidding system (supplier submits price offer).

👉 Deliverable: “Advanced supplier features.”

---

## **Milestone 6: Notifications & Customer Support (Week 6)**

* Email notifications (order confirmation).
* Live chat (basic Socket.io, or fake chat UI).
* Push/email offers (optional).

👉 Deliverable: “Customer engagement features.”

---

## **Milestone 7: Frontend Integration (Ongoing — Start Week 2, finish Week 7)**

* React frontend with:

  * Home page → list products.
  * Auth pages → register/login.
  * Dashboard → different for admin/wholesaler/customer.
  * Cart + checkout.
  * Order history.

👉 Deliverable: “Frontend + Backend integrated MERN app.”

---

# 🛠️ Flow of Work

1. Backend → get APIs working (tested in Postman).
2. Frontend → connect React to backend APIs.
3. Polish → add optional features (invoices, chat, discounts).
4. Documentation → write report, diagrams, future work.

---

⚡ Pro Tip: For FYP, even if you only complete till **Orders & Checkout (Milestone 4)**, you already have a solid project. Milestones 5–6 can be shown as **future improvements** if time runs out.

---

👉 Do you want me to **start with Milestone 2 (User Auth)** right now and write the schema + register/login API for you?
